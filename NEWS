Version Release History
=======================

Version 2.0.2 - October 31, 2012
   * Fixes a couple small issues pointed out to be immediately after 2.0.1
     release
   * Mac binaries now built on 10.6 in order to be forward-compatible with more
     Mac OS versions
   * Small changes to source to make it compile with gcc versions up to 4.7
     without warnings

Version 2.0.1 - October 31, 2012
   * First non-beta release.
   * Fixed an issue that would cause Bowtie 2 to use excessive amounts of
     memory for closely-matching and highly repetitive reads under some
     circumstances.
   * Fixed a bug in --mm mode that would fail to report when an index file
     could not be memory-mapped.
   * Added --non-deterministic option, which better matches how some users
     expect the pseudo-random generator inside Bowtie 2 to work.  Normally, if
     you give the same read (same name, sequence and qualities) and --seed, you
     get the same answer.  --non-deterministic breaks that guarantee.  This can
     be more appropriate for datasets where the input contains many identical
     reads (same name, same sequence, same qualities).
   * Fixed a bug in bowtie2-build would yield corrupt index files when memory
     settings were adjusted in the middle of indexing.
   * Clarified in manual that --un (or --un-*) options print reads exactly as
     they appeared in the input, and that they are not necessarily written in
     the same order as they appeared in the input.
   * Fixed issue whereby wrapper would incorrectly interpret arguments with
     --al as a prefix (e.g. --all) as --al.
   * Added option --omit-sec-seq, which causes Bowtie 2 to set SEQ and QUAL
     fields to "*" for secondary alignments.

Version 2.0.0-beta7 - July 9, 2012
   * Fixed an issue in how Bowtie 2 aligns longer reads in --local mode.  Some
     alignments were incorrectly curtailed on the left-hand side.
   * Fixed issue --un (or --un-*) would fail to output unaligned reads when
     --no-unal was also specified.
   * Fixed issue whereby --un-* were significantly slowing down Bowtie 2 when
     -p was set greater than 1.
   * Fixed issue that would could cause hangs in -a mode or when -k is set
     high.
   * Fixed issue whereby the SAM FLAGS field could be set incorrectly for
     secondary paired-end alignments with -a or -k > 1.
   * When input reads are unpaired, Bowtie 2 no longer removes the trailing /1
     or /2 from the read name.
   * -M option is now deprecated.  It will be removed in subsequent versions.
     What used to be called -M mode is still the default mode, and -k and -a
     are still there alternatives to the default mode, but adjusting the -M
     setting is deprecated.  Use the -D and -R options to adjust the effort
     expended to find valid alignments.
   * Gaps are now left-aligned in a manner similar to BWA and other tools.
   * Fixed issue whereby wrapper script would not pass on exitlevel correctly,
     sometimes spuriously hiding non-0 exitlevel.
   * Added documentation for YT:Z to manual.
   * Fixed documentation describing how Bowtie 2 searches for an index given an
     index basename.
   * Fixed inconsistent documentation for the default value of the -i parameter

Version 2.0.0-beta6 - May 7, 2012
   * Bowtie 2 now handles longer reads in a more memory-economical fashion,
     which should prevent many out-of-memory issues for longer reads.
   * Error message now produced when -L is set greater than 32.
   * Added a warning message to warn when bowtie2-align binary is being run
     directly, rather than via the wrapper.  Some functionality is provided by
     the wrapper, so Bowtie 2 should always be run via the bowtie2 executable
     rather than bowtie2-align.
   * Fixed an occasional crashing bug that was usually caused by setting the
     seed length relatively short.
   * Fixed an issue whereby the FLAG, RNEXT and PNEXT fields were incorrect for
     some paired-end alignments.  Specifically, this affected paired-end
     alignments where both mates aligned and one or both mates aligned
     non-uniquely.
   * Fixed issue whereby compressed input would sometimes be mishandled.
   * Renamed --sam-* options to omit the "sam-" prefix for brevity.  The old
     option names will also work.
   * Added --no-unal option to suppress SAM records corresponding to unaligned
     reads, i.e., records where FLAG field has 0x4 set.
   * Added --rg-id option and enhanced the documentation for both --rg-id and
     --rg.  Users were confused by the need to specify --rg "ID:(something)" in
     order for the @RG line to be printed; hopefully this is clearer now.
   * Index updates: indexes linked to in the right-hand sidebar have been
     updated to include the unplaced contigs appearing in the UCSC "random"
     FASTA files.  This makes the indexes more complete.  Also, an index for
     the latest mouse assembly, mm10 (AKA "GRCm38") has been added.

Version 2.0.0-beta5 - December 14, 2011
   * Added --un, --al, --un-conc, and --al-conc options that write unpaired
     and/or paired-end reads to files depending on whether they align at least
     once or fail to align.
   * Added --reorder option.  When enabled, the order of the SAM records output
     by Bowtie 2 will match the order of the input reads even when -p is set
     greater than 1.  This is disabled by default; enabling it makes Bowtie 2
     somewhat slower and use somewhat more memory when -p is set greater than
     1.
   * Changed the default --score-min in --local mode to G,20,8.  This ought to
     improve sensitivity and accuracy in many cases.
   * Improved error reporting.
   * Fixed some minor documentation issues.
   * Note: I am aware of an issue whereby longer reads (>10,000 bp) drive the
     memory footprint way up and often cause an out-of-memory exception.  This
     will be fixed in a future version.

Version 2.0.0-beta4 - December 5, 2011
   * Accuracy improvements.
   * Speed improvements in some situations.
   * Fixed a handful of crashing bugs.
   * Fixed some documentation bugs.
   * Fixed bug whereby --version worked incorrectly.
   * Fixed formatting bug with MD:Z optional field that would sometimes fail to
     follow a mismatch with a number.
   * Added -D option for controlling the maximum number of seed extensions that
     can fail in a row before we move on.  This option or something like it
	 will eventually replace the argument to -M.
   * Added -R option to control maximum number of times re-seeding is attempted
     for a read with repetitive seeds.
   * Changed default to --no-dovetail.  Specifying --dovetail turns it back on.
   * Added second argument for --mp option so that user can set maximum and
     minimum mismatch penalties at once.  Also tweaked the formula for
     calculating the quality-aware mismatch penalty.

Version 2.0.0-beta3 - November 1, 2011
   * Accuracy improvements.
   * Speed improvements in some situations.
   * Fixed a handful of crashing bugs.
   * Fixed a bug whereby number of repetitively aligned reads could be
     misreported in the summary output.

Version 2.0.0-beta2 - October 16, 2011
   * Added manual, both included in the download package and on the website.
     The website will always have the manual for the latest version.
   * Added Linux 32-bit and 64-bit binary packages.  Mac OS X packages to come.
     Still working on a Windows package.
   * Fixed a bug that led to crashes when seed-alignment result memory was
     exhausted.
   * Changed the --end-to-end mode --score-min default to be less permissive.
     The previous threshold seemed to be having an adverse effect on accuracy,
     though the fix implemented in this version comes at the expense of some
     sensitivity.
   * Changed the --end-to-end mode -M default to be lower by 2 notches.  This
     offsets any detrimental effect that the previous change would have had on
     speed, without a large adverse impact on accuracy.  As always, setting -M
     higher will yield still greater accuracy at the expense of speed.

Version 2.0.0-beta1 - September 22, 2011
   * First public release.
   * Caveats: as of now, the manual is incomplete, there's no tutorial, and no
     example genome or example reads.  All these will be fixed in upcoming
     releases.
   * Only a source package is currently available.  Platform-specific binaries
     will be included in future releases.
