Instructions for releasing a new version of Bowtie 2
====================================================

Author: Ben Langmead (langmea@cs.jhu.edu)
Date: 12/21/2012

Prerequisites:
- Need a way of building Linux binaries.  It's recommended that you not build
  on a Linux 3.X distro (for portability reasons)
- Need a way of building binaries for Mac OS X.
- Need a way of building Windows binaries, both 32-bit and 64-bit.
- Need "pandoc" installed on at least one of those machines.
- Need access to the GitHub repository.
- Need a sourceforge account with the appropriate permissions.

 1. Check that the code compiles with no issues, including with very recent
    versions of g++, and with clang on a Mac.
    - To use clang on the Mac: "make CPP=clang++ allall"

 2. Check that all the simple tests pass: "sh scripts/test/simple_tests.sh"

 3. Check that random tests pass: "sh scripts/sim/run.sh 1"

 4. Check that performance, sensitivity and accuracy are not substantially
    changed.
    - TODO!  Need infrastructure for this.

 5. Update VERSION with new version number if this hasn't already been done.

 6. Update NEWS and doc/website/recent_news.ssi if this hasn't already been
    done. (And even if it has, make sure the release date mentioned in those
    documents is correct.)
    - In both cases, add a section at the top describing the new release, along
      with bullet points describing improvements and changes in that release.
    - For recent_news.ssi, hyperlink concepts or command-line options so that
      they point into the manual.
    - Make sure to update the version numbers mentioned in the paragraph at the
      beginning of the NEWS file.
    - Potentially move an entry or two from the bottom of
      doc/website/recent_news.ssi to the top of doc/website/old_news.ssi if it
      gets too long.

 7. Update the text and html version of the manual, which are derived from the
    source MANUAL.markdown file.
    - In Bowtie 2 root directory, do "make doc" (you'll have to have 'pandoc'
      installed).  The output will be stored both in MANUAL and
      doc/manual.html.
    - In doc/manual.html, highlight and copy everything from <div id="TOC">
      down to but not including </body>.  Then paste it in the corresponding
      part of doc/website/manual.ssi.
    - Update the version number at the top of doc/website/manual.ssi.

 8. Go to the sourceforge site for the Bowtie 2 files:
    https://sourceforge.net/projects/bowtie-bio/files/bowtie2/
    And make a new directory (with "Add Folder" button) for the new version. 

 9. Update doc/website/rhsidebar.ssi to refer to the new version in the section
    immediately following "<h2>Latest Release</h2>"

10. Commit all changes due to the steps taken so far.

11. Upload updated webpages
   - In doc/website directory, do "sh push.sh"

12. Make Bowtie 2 source archive:
   - From the Bowtie 2 git root, run "make bowtie2-src"
   - Upload to sourceforge:
     scp bowtie2-X.Y.Z-source.zip USERNAME@frs.sourceforge.net:/home/frs/project/bowtie-bio/bowtie2/X.Y.Z/
     (But replace X.Y.Z and USERNAME with appropriate values)

13. Make Bowtie 2 Linux 32-bit and 64-bit binaries.
   - On a Linux machine (e.g. igmX), from the Bowtie 2 git root run "make clean"
   - Then "make BITS=32 bowtie2-bin".  (Use "make -j12" or similar to use many
     CPUs at once).
   - Rename the resulting archive to match the typical naming scheme.  E.g.:
     "mv bowtie2-X.Y.Z-32.zip bowtie2-X.Y.Z-linux-i386.zip"
   - Upload to sourceforge:
     scp bowtie2-X.Y.Z-linux-i386.zip USERNAME@frs.sourceforge.net:/home/frs/project/bowtie-bio/bowtie2/X.Y.Z/
     (But replace X.Y.Z and USERNAME with appropriate values)
   - Repeat from the beginning but replacing "32" with "64" and "i386" with
     "x86-64".

14. Make Bowtie 2 Mac OS X 32-bit and 64-bit binaries.
   - From the Bowtie 2 git root run "make clean"
   - Then "make EXTRA_FLAGS=-mmacosx-version-min=10.5 BITS=32 bowtie2-bin".
     (Use "make -j12" or similar to use many CPUs at once).  The -mmacosx...
	 flag forces the binaries to be backward compatible with Mac OS version
	 10.5 and up.
   - Rename the resulting archive to match the typical naming scheme.  E.g.:
     "mv bowtie2-X.Y.Z-32.zip bowtie2-X.Y.Z-macos-i386.zip"
   - Upload to sourceforge:
     scp bowtie2-X.Y.Z-macos-i386.zip USERNAME@frs.sourceforge.net:/home/frs/project/bowtie-bio/bowtie2/X.Y.Z/
     (But replace X.Y.Z and USERNAME with appropriate values)
   - Repeat from the beginning but replacing "32" with "64" and "i386" with
     "x86-64".

15. Make Windows 32-bit and 64-bit binaries
   - TODO!  Need to regularly build Bowtie 2 on Windows.

16. Make a git annotated tag for the new version using "git tag -a"
   - See: http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Tagging
   - Basically, do something like:
     + git tag -a v2.0.5 -m 'Just prior to 2.0.5 release on 1/4/2013'
     + git push origin --tags

17. Update the sourceforge "Looking for the latest version?" pointers:
   - Go to: https://sourceforge.net/projects/bowtie-bio/files/bowtie2/X.Y.Z
   - Click the "i" ("info") button next to the Mac OS X 64-bit archive.  Check
     the Mac os "Default Download For:" checkbox and save.
   - Do same for Linux 64-bit archive and the Linux checkbox.
   - Do same for Windows.
   - Click the "i" ("info") button next to the source archive.  Check all the
     "Default Download For:" checkboxes not checked so far and save.

18. Send an email to bowtie-bio-announce@lists.sourceforge.net announcing the
    release.
   - Subject: "Bowtie 2 X.Y.Z released"
   - Body: Basically a copy and paste of the release notes for the most recent
     release from the NEWS file.
