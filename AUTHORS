A DLL from the pthreads for Win32 library is distributed with the Win32 version
of Bowtie 2.  The pthreads for Win32 library and the GnuWin32 package have many

The ForkManager.pm perl module is used in Bowtie 2's random testing framework,
and is included as scripts/sim/contrib/ForkManager.pm.  ForkManager.pm is
written by dLux (Szabo, Balazs), with contributions by others.  See the perldoc
in ForkManager.pm for the complete list.

The file ls.h includes an implementation of the Larsson-Sadakane suffix sorting
algorithm.  The implementation is by N. Jesper Larsson and was adapted somewhat
for use in Bowtie 2.

Various users have kindly supplied patches, bug reports and feature requests
over the years.  Many, many thanks go to them.
